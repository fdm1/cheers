# Hack day

Learn about:
- react-native

Build a cross-platform app using react-native that can:
- talk to some free APIs (tbd) and display responses from them
  - https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis
    - random drink: https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php (https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api/json/v1/1/random.php)
- try including an API that connects and interacts with a websocket
